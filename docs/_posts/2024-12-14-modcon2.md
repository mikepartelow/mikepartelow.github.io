And now for something completely different!

I started learning Rust about 3 years ago, the old fashioned way: reading, writing toy programs with what I understood, reading more, writing more, and so on.

Then I got a job writing Go and Python, and set Rust aside.

Since then, AI assistants have become popular. 

## tl;dr

- Copilot is an amazing partner for learning a new language!
- Provided you already understand programming fundamentals.
- Provided you're already good at code reviews, because it will produce subtle bugs.
- Starting from "I did some Rust 3 years ago", I got a working MVP in about a week.
- Copilot injected a number of bugs and some unnecessary complexity. Debugging (at the appropriate time) accelerated my learning. Minimizing the complexity (at the appropriate time) solidified my learning.

If I was not already an expert programmer [FIXME: footnote humblebrag] I doubt I could have made such fast progress, even with an AI assistant, particularly in Rust.
