## Have you tried not doing it?

Shunryu Suzuki said: *If your practice makes you worse, it is ridiculous.*

Sometimes the most impactful improvement you can make is to *stop doing something*.

[In context](https://hakone-zendo.org/2024/01/28/zen-and-excitement/), that's not exactly what Suzuki meant, but also in content, it's precisely what he meant.

This same sentiment goes by the name *sunk cost fallacy*, but I find Shunryu Suzuki more fun to read than Richard Thaler.

## Serious advice

Shunryu Suzuki: *Each of you is perfect the way you are ... and you can use a little improvement.*

Richard Thaler: *A good rule of thumb is to assume that everything matters.*

When everything matters, you need to take everything into account to make optimal decisions. That's a lot of cognitive load. To squeeze a little improvement out of perfection, it can help to reduce the scope of what matters - to constrain "everything".

## Great, I'm already perfect, now I want to improve my software

Neither Suzuki nor Thaler said: *There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.*

That was the inventor of Quicksort, [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare).

Software is better overall when it's simpler. Software that is simple can be understood by more people. Software that doesn't exist at all has no maintenance cost and no bugs.

If your practice is complexity, it may be ridiculous.
