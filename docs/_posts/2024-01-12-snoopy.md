## Bottom Line Up Front

[Here's the code](https://github.com/mikepartelow/snoopy)

## What

I have a client that generates requests to a server. The server responds with a list of URLs. The client then requests each of the returned URLs.

The server can return a list of URLs that point to a different server.

I want to migrate a subset of the the URL lists (indexes) and a subset of the URLs (files) to a separate host (Dan, I guess), so I can replay some important request/response sequences and messure their performance.

Bob and Charlie host thousands or millions of indexes and files, so I don't want to migrate all of them, only the ones I need for the sequences I want to benchmark.

I built a [YAML-configured man-in-the-middle logging and mutating HTTP proxy](https://github.com/mikepartelow/snoopy) in [Go](https://go.dev/) to capture all the URL that would be requested during my benchmarks. I called it `snoopy`.

## What?

The proxy is configured with a simple YAML file.

[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) fits the pattern of the system I want to benchmark. It returns [indexes](https://pypi.org/pypi/numpy/json) from `pypi.org` that point to files on `files.pythonhosted.org`. If I want to log all the HTTP calls made during a call to `pip add`, I can't just capture all the calls going to `pypi.org` because then I'd miss the equally important calls to `files.pythonhosted.org`.

Here's a useful `snoopy` `config.yaml` for `PyPI`.

```yaml
- upstream: https://pypi.org
  local: 127.0.0.1:9999
  logfile: pypi-index.urls
  headers:
    - name: User-Agent
      value: snoopy/v1
  response-rewrites:
    - old: https://files.pythonhosted.org
      new: http://localhost:9998
- upstream: https://files.pythonhosted.org
  local: 127.0.0.1:9998
  logfile: pypi-files.urls
```

This example sets up two HTTP servers. One listens on port `9999`, proxies requests to pypi.org with an added `User-Agent` header, logs the requests to `pypi-index.urls`, and mutates the responses to replace occurrences of `https://files.pythonhosted.org` with `http://localhost:9998`.

The other server listens on port `9998`, proxies requests to `https://files.pythonhosted.org`, and logs all requests to `pypi-files.urls`.

## Logging and Mutating

With the above config, I can start the server in one terminal window:

```bash
%  make run
golangci-lint run
go test -race -cover ./...
?   	mp/snoopy/cmd/snoopy	[no test files]
?   	mp/snoopy/pkg/logging	[no test files]
ok  	mp/snoopy/pkg/snoopy	(cached)	coverage: 60.0% of statements
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build  -o . ./cmd/...
LOG_LEVEL=debug ./snoopy
time=2024-01-10T21:13:08.827-08:00 level=DEBUG source=pkg/snoopy/snoopy.go:51 msg="Starting snoop server" local=127.0.0.1:9998 upstream=https://files.pythonhosted.org local=127.0.0.1:9998 upstream=https://files.pythonhosted.org logfile=pypi-files.urls
time=2024-01-10T21:13:08.827-08:00 level=DEBUG source=pkg/snoopy/snoopy.go:51 msg="Starting snoop server" local=127.0.0.1:9999 upstream=https://pypi.org local=127.0.0.1:9999 upstream=https://pypi.org logfile=pypi-index.urls
```

Then run a `pip install` in a different window, pointing it at `snoopy`.

```bash
% pip install --trusted-host localhost --index-url http://localhost:9999/simple --no-deps pandas
```

`snoopy` rewrote the `pypi.org` response's references to `https://files.pythonhosted.org` as `http://localhost:9998`, and generated two log files.

```bash
% cat pypi-index.urls
https://pypi.org/simple/pandas/
% cat pypi-files.urls
https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/54/be/98b894bef9acfc310de70fc03524473a9695981e1e87c7afa56ada08f016/pandas-2.1.4-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl.metadata
https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/54/be/98b894bef9acfc310de70fc03524473a9695981e1e87c7afa56ada08f016/pandas-2.1.4-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl
```

Now we have a list of all the HTTP requests we'd need to serve from an arbitrary server to successfully `pip install --no-deps pandas`. To populate such a server, we can concatenate the files and insert a `curl -O` in front of each line, then run it as a shell script.

`snoopy` can also insert cookies and HTTP headers, which can be very useful if some of the proxied endpoints require particular cookies or headers - for example, API keys.

## Did it work?

Yes, it worked. I got the information I needed to set up my test.

## Why, though?

Why not use [someone else's code](https://mitmproxy.org/)? I wrote `snoopy` on the weekend when I was supposed to be folding laundry or something. Isn't that reason enough?

I took the opportunity to practice some fundamentals, like parsing `YAML`, serving and requesting `HTTP`, and unit testing with [httptest.Server](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httptest#example-Server). I gained insights into the system I was testing that may not have been surfaced by using [somoene else's tooling](https://www.wireshark.org/).

Mostly, though: I find programming fun. Sure, learning [someone else's](https://httptoolkit.com/) version of the same thing has benefits, but it's just not as fun as writing my own code. 

YMMV.

## Parting Praise

My initial implementation supported just one `HTTP` listener, but when I realized I needed 2+, my code changes were easy and elegant, because [Go concurrency](https://gobyexample.com/waitgroups) is easy and elegant.

```go
	var snoop Snoop
	err = yaml.NewDecoder(file).Decode(&snoops)
```

became

```go
	var snoops []Snoop
	err = yaml.NewDecoder(file).Decode(&snoops)
```

and 

```go
    func (s *Snoopy) Run() {
        snoop := s.snoop
        snoop.Logger.Debug("Starting snoop server", "local", snoop.Local, "upstream", snoop.Upstream, "logfile", snoop.Logfile)
        if err := http.ListenAndServe(snoop.Local, &snoop); err != nil {
            snoop.Logger.Error("ListenAndServe:", err)
            panic(err)
        }
    }
```

became

```
func (s *Snoopy) Run() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for _, snoop := range s.snoops {
		snoop := snoop

		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()

			snoop.Logger.Debug("Starting snoop server", "local", snoop.Local, "upstream", snoop.Upstream, "logfile", snoop.Logfile)
			if err := http.ListenAndServe(snoop.Local, &snoop); err != nil {
				snoop.Logger.Error("ListenAndServe:", err)
				panic(err)
			}
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```

The new `Run()` is longer, but only because of standard-issue boilerplate familiar to most [Gophers](https://go.dev/blog/gopher).
