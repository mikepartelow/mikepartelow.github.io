## MU

Everybody knows the classic [Zen Koan MU](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Mu-Essential-Writings-Important/dp/0861716434):

> A monk asked Joshu: "Does a dog have Buddha Nature?" Joshu said, "Mu!"

After working with this Koan for a while, I found my response, for now at least.

It is this:

> A monk asked Dogen: "Does a dog have Buddha Nature?" Dogen said, "[Adopt!](https://www.aspca.org/adopt-pet)".
