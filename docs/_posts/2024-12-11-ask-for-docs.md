## Story Time!

I needed to do a thing at work, but didn't know how to do it. It was the second time the thing had needed to be done at the company.

I could have spent an hour or two to figure it out, but I also had access to a subject matter expert.

Instead of asking for help, I asked the expert to document the process, with both of us agreeing that the documentation task would take about 30 minutes.

30 minutes later, I ran through the steps in the document, adding minor typo corrections and clarifications that I found useful. I pushed my changes up to the repo, updated the Jira ticket with links to th doc, and moved on to a new task.

Total time spent on this task:

- 30 minutes of my expert colleague's time
- 10 minutes of my time

Versus an hour or two of my own time figuring it out from scratch, or interrupting my colleague over the course of an hour and capturing the process in a private Slack thread.

## Don't ask an expert for help, ask an expert for documentation

- After 40 short minutes, we now had a **validated** document of steps that definitely work to complete a now-and-future recurring manual task.
- I enhanced the documentation with a script, so now it's a partially automated process.
- The document captured a dependency installation *gotcha* that would have wasted plenty of time as I troubleshot it myself - but I didn't have to.
- The next time we do this, we have a document explaining how it's done and a script to do it. A new hire with no context can now do it.
- The document included all prerequisite dependencies, which the expert's initial "quick help" Slack messages did not include.

Be kind to your future self and team: ask an expert for documentation, validate the documentation, and save yourself lots of time in the future.

## Don't offer help, you expert, offer documentation

If you're the expert and someone asks for help, you should send them documentation instead. Write a document and ask your colleague to validate it. This will probably surface a lot of things that you, the expert, believe are obvious, but are actually not obvious at all and therefore need to be documented.
